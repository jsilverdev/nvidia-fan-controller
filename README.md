# Nvidia GPU Fan Controller for linux

A simple **standalone python script** to keep your Nvidia GPUs below a given temperature, e.g.

```
python3 nvidia_fan_controller.py --target-temperature 60
```

This script uses a simple [PID-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) to regulate
the fan speed.


## Dependencies

The `nvidia_fan_controller.py` script does not depend on any other python libraries. It does,
however, require the following command-line utility:

- `nvidia-settings`

Please make sure that these are installed on your system.

Also, make sure that you've enabled manual fan control on your system. This can be done by using the
`nvidia-xconfig` command-line utility:

```
nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=4
```

To update your `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` manually instead, scroll down to see an example.


## Stress test

It is important to stress test your system to ensure that it won't catch fire ðŸ”¥

I found this simple stress test tool called [gpu-burn](https://github.com/wilicc/gpu-burn). Here are
the steps I use to run the stress test.

First let's clone this repo and the stress-test repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/KristianHolsheimer/nvidia-fan-controller.git
git clone https://github.com/wilicc/gpu-burn.git
```

Navigate to the `nvidia-fan-controller` dir and run:
```
python3 nvidia_fan_controller.py --target-temperature 60
```

In another terminal, navigate to the `gpu-burn` dir and compile (you only need to do this once):

```
make
```

then run (10 minutes = 600 secs):

```
./gpu-burn 600
```

You may want to open a third terminal to monitor your GPUs:

```
nvidia-smi --loop=1
```

If you'd like to selectively stress-test your GPUs, you can set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` variable.
For example, here's how I sandwich an idle GPU between two fully-loaded ones:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,2 ./gpu-burn 600
```

## Install as a service

You would probably like to **automatically start** the controller at start-up. Here's how to do that
using `systemd`.

It is highly recommended to a stress-test (like the example above) to check if the fan speed is
properly regulated by the controller.

Create a systemd service file:

```
python3 nvidia_fan_controller.py --create-service-file
```

This creates a file called `nvidia-fan-controller.service` in the same dir as the main script. Check
the contents of the service file to see if all fields are populated properly.

If all looks good, install the service using the following sequence of commands:

```
sudo cp nvidia-fan-controller.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable nvidia-fan-controller.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart nvidia-fan-controller.service
```


## Uninstall service

If you wish to uninstall the service, run the following commands to undo the installation steps
outlined above:

```
sudo systemctl stop nvidia-fan-controller.service
sudo systemctl disable nvidia-fan-controller.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/nvidia-fan-controller.service
```


## Example xorg.conf

Here's the xorg.conf that I use for my system. I've got three GPUs: one GTX 1080Ti and two GTX
1070Ti. This `/etc/X11/xorg.conf` file sets the
[Coolbits](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Tips_and_tricks#Overclocking_and_cooling)
option to **4**, which tells the nvidia driver to allow all fan settings to be set manually.
